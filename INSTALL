For those that downloaded a tarball. (i.e. NOT from Git) run the compile,
build/install four-step.

untar it (you've obviously already did this if you're reading this file...)

./configure
make
sudo make install <-- required for MegaTunix to work
sudo ldconfig     <-- required for MegaTunix to work

For those that used Git
first update your tree:
	git pull master
Then regenerate things that aren't in Git (And should NOT be)
	./autogen.sh

The build as above (./configure;make;sudo make install; sudo ldconfig)

a "sudo make uninstall" will remove all files created that "make install" placed
on your system.  It will NOT remove directories though.  so if you want
to get rid of everything delete /usr/local/share/MegaTunix (assumes you ran
./configure with no options to change the default prefix of "/usr/local")
