MegaTunix designed and written by David J. Andruczyk

	Inspiration for this code came from Bruce Bowling and Al Grippo, 
designers of the MegaSquirt DIY Fuel Injection ECU.  This code was initially 
modelled slightly after Bruce and Al's MegaSquirt PCC tuning software 
for Windows.  Inspiration also came from Eric Fahlgrens and Guy Hill's
MegaTune, also for Windows.  Since that time it has turning into it's own
original application with many benefits and differences from MegaTune and
other tuning softwares.

NOTE about fonts:
	Some people have complained that MegaTunix comes up with abnormally
huge fonts.  This is NOT MegaTunix's fault.  It's caused by the default font
for Gnome being set to large.  This problem is mostly seen by people NOT 
using the Gnome desktop.   MegaTunix uses the GTK+2 libraries which are the 
foundation libraries by which Gnome's gui is based upon.  The fix is to run 
"gnome-font-properties" and set the "Application Font" size to a smaller 
point size.  On the authors' system a Application Font of "Sans" at 8pt, 
looks the best.

System requirements:
	MegaTunix is developed on Ubuntu Linux.  Most RPM and Debian 
based distros split packages into a runtime and devel package.  Runtime 
ones are needed to run the program, and devel packages are needed for 
programs like megatunix to compile against.

MegaTunix requires the following libraries (and their dependancies);
* minimum GTK-2.10 and the dev package
  - GTK+ depends on pango, fontconfig, freetype2, pango, glib and atk
* Gtkglext-1.x (and the dev package)
  - gtkglext depends on gtk+ and glib
* Xorg  development libraries (xorg-devel)
  - libglade-2.x (and dev package)
  - libglade depends on libxml-2.x and gtk+-2.x

Optional:
  The Glade GUI designer can be installed to modify and add new gui tabs to
megatunix for your own custom firmware needs.  This is ONLY needed if you want
to modify megatunix or design custom tabs for your firmware.  
I recommend glade-2.x
